iStoryline.js is a JavaScript library for producing storyline visualizations with diverse sketchy styles. [Storyline visualization](https://xkcd.com/657/) is a fancy way to tell a story. Lines represent characters in the story. This fancy visualization naturally has some advantages in explaining the story:

- The overall trend of the lines can vividly represent the evolution of the plot.
- The interval between the lines can also display the relation of the characters.

Example storyline visualizations created using iStoryline.js. The styles and visual labels are customized manually to embellish the storylines.
For more information, please check [our paper](http://www.tantang.org/publication/2018_infovis_istoryline/2018_infovis_istoryline.pdf) and the [supplement material](https://istoryline.github.io/).

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/add/) to install iStoryline.

```Shell
npm install i-storyline-js
```

or

```Shell
yarn add i-storyline-js
```

## Basic Usage

```JavaScript
import iStoryline from "i-storyline-js"
let iStoryliner = new iStoryline();

// generate storyline visualizations from the story script
let storyScriptUrl = './data/xml/Redcap.xml';

// graph can be drawed using any canvas or svg libraries
let graph = iStoryliner.load(storyScriptUrl);

// obtain the characters names
console.log(graph.characters);  // ['Red cap', 'Mother', 'Wolf', 'GrandMa']

// obtain the paths of the characters
console.log(graph.storylines);  // [[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...], ...]
```

### TODO

- provide the drawing APIs based on [canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp) or [svg](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_svg.asp).
